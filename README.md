### I am Rayan Mazouz.

I like doing backend stuff, keep things [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle), and I truly believe javascript is crap (but necessary).

My favorite languages are Rust, C, Python and C#

Programming is just logic and syntax, so I believe that given enough time and resources, I can develop anything I want.
I love learning new things, overcoming challenges, solving problems, and emerge from it as a better developer.

I'm a perfectionist, and I hate every single line of code I write (if not right away, a few months later). that's why my github is kinda empty 🙃.
Working with other people makes me better at what I do.

In my opinion, the most important quality of a programmer is their ability to write clean code with a good software design pattern. That's why I like the functionnal side of programming languages, even though they're a little out of touch with the real world.
