### I am Rayan Mazouz.

I like doing backend stuff, keep things [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle), and I truly believe javascript is crap (but necessary).

My favorite languages are Rust, C, Python, C# and Haskell.

Programming is just logic and syntax, so I believe that given enough time and resources, I can code anything I want.
I love learning new things, overcoming challenges, and emerge from it as a better developer.

I'm a perfectionist, and I hate every single line of code I write (if not right away, a few months later). that's why my github is kinda empty ðŸ™ƒ.
Working with other people makes me better at what I do.


I studied one year at [EPITA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_pour_l%27informatique_et_les_techniques_avanc%C3%A9es), then decided to change schools because I wanted to code more, and do more low level programming. I am now in my first year of [EPITECH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitech).

I use arch (and rust) btw.
